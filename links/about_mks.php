          <h1 class="lead">Maria Katrina School</h1>
          <p> The year was 1996 when Mr. and Mrs. Camilon were offered to buy MIDES Learning Center, a preschool operated by Mrs. Luisa Garcia in a 312 sq.m. lot at Saog, Marilao, Bulacan.</p>
          <p>Armed with good business education and genuine love for children, this kind couple set forth to a determined endeavor of reviving the learning center and later developing it into an elementary school.</p>
          

    
      <h1 class="lead">Growth and Development</h1>
      <p>Maria Katrina School education recognizes each child as an individual in his own pattern of growth and development. The curriculum, therefore, provides rich and stimulating learning experiences, which enable him to
        acquire the maximum basic educational foundation and formation. </p>
    <p>It gives due consideration of the child's attitudes in the process of his development into useful citizen of his country and an abiding child of God. Thus the
        program offers to train and turn out children who:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>possess the basic understanding of their being children of a loving Father who is God himself;</li>
            <li>have developed self-discipline even at an early age;</li>
            <li>enjoy learning even at an early age;</li>
            <li>have developed motor coordination and creativity through the varied experiences learned in school and at home; and</li>
            <li>are able to interact and relate well with others.</li>
            </ol>

              <p>
              The Maria Katrina School adheres to the belief that it is through the quality of education a child gets that he is able to adapt himself to the changes of times; thus, preparing him to become a responsible citizen in
                the services of God and country.

              "Yielding responsible citizens dedicated to the service of God and Country".

          <h1 class="lead">Goals and Objectives</h1>
      <p>In June of 1997, the Learning Center, then catering to preschoolers and first graders, was named Maria Katrina School. Maria Katrina School started with 70 preschoolers and 20 grade I pupils, taught in improvised
        classrooms.</p>
        <p> Soon enough,the need for additional classroom was felt and a six classroom - two-storey building was erected in summer of 1998. On its second year, Maria Katrina School operated preschool and elementary
        education from Grade I to Grade VI pupils.</p>
        <p>The year 1999 is a very optimistic year for the Katrinians. Two additional rooms were built to accomodate an increasing population. Maria Katrina has yet to prove herself though, but she surely has gone a long
        way since her humble beginnings.</p>
